								<p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed testimonial-full hidden">
									I recently had the absolute pleasure of trying out a new home cooking service called AllÃ´ Chef, run by David, and I can't recommend it enough! The whole process was seamless from the start. We had a quick chat about food preferences, dietary needs, and general likes/dislikes. David then sent me a super clear and organised list of ingredients to buy, no stress, no fuss.<br><br>On the day, he arrived right on time and got straight to work in the kitchen. In just three hours, he had prepared five incredible meals for the week all neatly packed and labelled, complete with easy-to-follow reheating instructions. As a busy person having dinners prepped and ready was honestly a game changer. It meant I could spend my evenings doing other things instead of being in the kitchen. The servings were generous and it even meant we had leftovers to take to work the next day.<br><br>The meals themselves were delicious and full of variety. We had a beautiful salmon quiche, perfectly cooked blue cod papillote, a comforting Asian-style chicken chowder, and even a classic croque monsieur, every dish was full of flavour and made with care.<br><br>Not only was it a huge time-saver, but it also gave me a much-needed break from the kitchen. I still got to enjoy home-cooked meals without the usual planning, prepping, and cleaning that goes with it. AllÃ´ Chef is such a clever concept, and David delivers it with professionalism, warmth, and skill. Highly recommend this service to anyone who needs a bit of breathing space in their week or just wants to eat really good food without the effort!

									What a treat! Having a week off cooking was amazing. David came round the week before and we talked about food preferences, allergies and intolerances and then he checked out my kitchen to see what equipment I had. He then came up with a great menu â€“ some really practical options that were big enough to allow for lunches the next day.<br><br>On the day of the cook-up I came home to a clean and tidy kitchen and five great looking dishes, with instructions on storing and re-heating. Having two teens with contrasting tastes was challenging, but the dishes hit the mark â€“ they were tasty, filling and healthy.<br><br>The big bonus was being able to come home from work, go to the gym and then just eat, without having to start all over with meal prep and cooking. A much more relaxing week. I'd definitely recommend!

										I recently had the absolute pleasure of trying out a new home cooking service called AllÃ´ Chef, run by David, and I can't recommend it enough! The whole process was seamless from the start. We had a quick chat about food preferences, dietary needs, and general likes/dislikes. David then sent me a super clear and organised list of ingredients to buy, no stress, no fuss.<br><br>On the day, he arrived right on time and got straight to work in the kitchen. In just three hours, he had prepared five incredible meals for the week all neatly packed and labelled, complete with easy-to-follow reheating instructions. As a busy person having dinners prepped and ready was honestly a game changer. It meant I could spend my evenings doing other things instead of being in the kitchen. The servings were generous and it even meant we had leftovers to take to work the next day.<br><br>The meals themselves were delicious and full of variety. We had a beautiful salmon quiche, perfectly cooked blue cod papillote, a comforting Asian-style chicken chowder, and even a classic croque monsieur, every dish was full of flavour and made with care.<br><br>Not only was it a huge time-saver, but it also gave me a much-needed break from the kitchen. I still got to enjoy home-cooked meals without the usual planning, prepping, and cleaning that goes with it. AllÃ´ Chef is such a clever concept, and David delivers it with professionalism, warmth, and skill. Highly recommend this service to anyone who needs a bit of breathing space in their week or just wants to eat really good food without the effort!

										What a treat! Having a week off cooking was amazing. David came round the week before and we talked about food preferences, allergies and intolerances and then he checked out my kitchen to see what equipment I had. He then came up with a great menu â€“ some really practical options that were big enough to allow for lunches the next day.<br><br>On the day of the cook-up I came home to a clean and tidy kitchen and five great looking dishes, with instructions on storing and re-heating. Having two teens with contrasting tastes was challenging, but the dishes hit the mark â€“ they were tasty, filling and healthy.<br><br>The big bonus was being able to come home from work, go to the gym and then just eat, without having to start all over with meal prep and cooking. A much more relaxing week. I'd definitely recommend!
